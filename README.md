## Tutorial description

Networks also known as graphs are fundamental to many aspects of modern society, from the internet, to transport, social networks, energy grids, health, and businesses. To effectively analyse these systems we need a deeper understanding of networks and the techniques available to work with them. Recently, new machine learning methods based on advancements in neural network representation learning have been developed to analyse graphs for prediction, visualisation and decision making. 

This tutorial will give an introduction to machine learning on graphs and more specifically representation learning using graph neural networks (GNNs). We will discuss several state-of-the-art techniques for small and large graphs. We will cover fundamental graph data structures and predictive analytics using manual feature engineering and modern GNNs. Additional topics will include unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised learning for node clustering, node classification, link prediction and graph property prediction. We are also going to briefly discuss how to scale graph neural networks to huge graphs with billions of nodes. 

Participants will gain experience applying machine learning on graphs solving real-world problems using Python's machine learning modules, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and the [Deep Graph Library (DGL)](https://www.dgl.ai/). Participants should have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts and Python programming skills.
